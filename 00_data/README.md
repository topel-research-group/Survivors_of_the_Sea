# Quality control procedure
1. Cutadapt - Illumina adaptor removal, quality trimming of bases with Phred score below 30, with a minimum read length of 50bp
  * `Trimmed` directory
2. SortMeRNA - Removal of rRNA sequences, based on the S. marinoi genome (and some manual checking of rRNA boundaries)
  * `rRNA_Filter` directory
3. PRINSEQ - Trimming of long (10+) polyA/T tails from reads, and removal of reads subsequently shorter than 50bp
  * `PolyA_Removal` directory
