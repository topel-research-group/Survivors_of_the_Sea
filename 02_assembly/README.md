# Attempting a de novo assembly using Trinity, to see how the results compare to our current transcriptome

Assemble all R05 together, and all GF04 together?
* Then compare

Can also include these results in the Maker annotation
* Would need to restart, but this is okay if the parallelisation problem can also be fixed...
