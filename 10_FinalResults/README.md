## Results summary
In each control vs. resting comparison, only around 2000-4000 genes are up/downregulated with |LFC| > 1,
and around 3000-5000 are up/downregulated with |LFC| > 0.585, meaning that the majority do not appear to
be differentially expressed (see [`04_DiffExp`](../04_DiffExp)),  despite resting stages being 'dormant'
