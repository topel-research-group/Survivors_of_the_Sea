## Results summary
In each control vs. resting comparison, only around 2000-4000 genes are up/downregulated with |LFC| > 1,  
and around 3000-5000 are up/downregulated with |LFC| > 0.585, meaning that the majority do not appear to  
be differentially expressed (see [`04_DiffExp`](../04_DiffExp)),  despite resting stages being 'dormant'  
* DOUBLE-CHECK RESULTS WITHOUT LFC THRESHOLD

## Pathways

### Citric Acid Cycle
Relevance: Energy release from fats, carbohydrates and proteins, and production of NADH and AA precursors

The cycle overall seems to have a 56d uptick, slightly delayed after addition of nutrients, before dropping
