# Mapping the RNAseq reads to the R05 transcriptome

How many reads map to the reference genome?

How many reads map to the current transcriptome?
* How many map to an exons-only transcriptome?

What about multimappers?

How big is the mapping difference between strains?
* Presumably GF04 won't map as well as R05...
