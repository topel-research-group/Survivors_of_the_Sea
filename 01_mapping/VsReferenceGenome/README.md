# Mapping the RNAseq reads to the reference genome to get an idea of how well everything maps

Adding a `--max-intronlen` parameter of 10000, as the results from `OLD_VsReferenceGenome` had a lot of big gaps
* Added additional parameters for final analysis; see [StricterMapping/README.md](StricterMapping/README.md)
